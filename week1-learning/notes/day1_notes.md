# Day 1 – Web Scraping Fundamentals

## What is Web Scraping?
[cite_start]Web scraping is the automated process of extracting specific, structured data from websites. [cite_start]Instead of manually copying and pasting, we use code (like Python or Node.js) to "read" the HTML of a page and pull out only the information we need, such as prices, names, or links[cite: 27].

## Why is it Useful?
It is a critical tool for businesses and automation teams for several reasons:
* [cite_start]**Efficiency at Scale:** It allows us to collect thousands of data points in seconds, which would be impossible to do manually[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Accuracy:** Automated scraping reduces human error, ensuring the data is captured exactly as it appears[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Data Structuring:** It turns messy website code into clean files like CSV or JSON that can be used by other teams[cite: 7, 21].
* [cite_start]**Common Use Cases:** Lead generation, price monitoring, and gathering research data[cite: 7].

## My Setup
I have successfully configured my environment with:
* [cite_start]**VS Code** for writing and debugging code[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**Python & Node.js** for static and dynamic scraping[cite: 37, 38].
* [cite_start]**GitHub** for tracking progress and delivering clean datasets[cite: 39, 74].
